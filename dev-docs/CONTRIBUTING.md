# How to contribute to the Tables team

The Tables team is focused on simplifying the onboarding process for new volunteers. The primary technologies used are a set of Google products, one being Google Tables. Automation scripts are run using Google App Scripts. In order to have a better understanding of how to access and use these technologies, please read the documentation below.

## What is Google Tables?

Google Tables is a Google beta product that acts as a collaborative database program with easy integration for automations. For more information on Tables please see here: https://support.google.com/area120-tables/answer/9902872?hl=en

## Getting access to 1Password

Due to the nature of this project, the code is not hosted on GitHub, but rather, a private Google Account. In order to get access to the code for this project and all the resources, you will need to have been pre-approved to work on this project. If you have not been pre-approved, please attend onboarding and express to Bonnie Wolfe your interest in joining this project or reach out in the [#tables](https://app.slack.com/client/T04502KQX/C02LPQXUWJ0) Slack channel.

Once you are approved, you will be given access to the Tables 1Password account which includes the passwords to all the accounts you will need to run this project. If you have not already done so, please sign up for a 1Password account. For a run-down of all the current 1Password accounts please see the [1Password.md] file.

## Where to find the files you will use

Once given access to 1Password, login to tables@hackforla.org. Go to that account’s Google Drive. The code for this project is in the "Scripts" folder and clicking on the "Tables Scripts" file will open up the code in the Google App Scripts Editor.

To find the actual Google Tables project, simply google “google tables” and click on the first result (must be signed into tables@hackforla.org). You will then be prompted to “Try Tables Now” click that and then click on “HfLA Volunteers” to enter the correct Table.

## Signing in to hackforla-onboarding GitHub account

You may also need to sign into the GitHub Bot account that is used on the project for automations involving GitHub. The account login information for this is also in 1Password. The GitHub login name is “hackforla-onboarding”. You will also need Two-Factor authentication codes to login to the GitHub account. These codes can also be found in 1Password. See [1Password.md] for a run-down of the various accounts and passwords located in the 1Password account.

## Next steps

From here, you should have access to all of the correct files and accounts you need. For a run-down on how Google Tables works and is connected to the automations, see here: [tables.md]. For a run-down on the actual App Scripts and functions that power the automations, see here: [app-scripts.md].
